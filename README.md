# OrchardProject
Orchard token employs existing balancer pool technology to create an eco-system comprised of several different balancer pools (each consisting of their own tokens that have a common denominator relating each one)

There are 4 different baskets that are available to pool into, each basket has tokens with similarities. The final feature is a self-created basket which gives the opportunity to strategically allocate contents of the other baskets into one place.

The baskets all must contain orchard token, they are named Apple, Orange, Cherry, Pear and Peach
